    * **FR4.2**: Agent shall integrate with **Notion** (via Zapier) for note-taking and information storage.
    * **FR4.3**: Agent shall integrate with **Google Calendar** (via Zapier) for setting events, deadlines, and reminders.
* **FR5: Seven Node Blueprint Application** (Internal architectural guidance for the coding assistant)
    * **LLM Node**: Core for NLU, planning, prioritization, summarization.
    * **Tool Node**: Interface with Zapier, internal timers, note-taking functions.
    * **Control Node**: Manage daily briefings, prioritization logic, command routing.
    * **Memory Node**: Store goals, tasks, user preferences, daily progress, conversation history (cloud-based for persistence and potential future multi-platform sync – specific database TBD by coding assistant, e.g., Firebase Firestore, Supabase).
    * **User Input Node**: Handle voice/text from the desktop application.
    * **Guardrail Node**: Validate inputs, ensure consistent outputs.
    * **Fallback Node**: Manage errors from API calls or internal processes.

**5. Technical Stack & Key Integrations (Summary)**

* **Speech-to-Text**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API (using free tier)
* **Text-to-Speech**: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API (using free tier)
* **Backend Logic/LLM**: Cloud-based model from OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Anthropic Claude
* **Cloud Storage for Memory**: Supabase (preferred due to MCP integration) or Firebase
* **Integrations Layer**: Zapier
    * **Task Management**: Trello
    * **Note-Taking**: Notion
    * **Calendar/Reminders**: Google Calendar
* **Platform - Initial Focus**: Windows-first desktop application
    * Recommended framework options: Electron (for rapid MVP) or .NET MAUI (for Windows-optimized performance)

**6. User Interaction and Design (High-Level)**

* **Desktop Application**: Minimalist interface activated by hotkey, allowing quick voice or text input without disrupting workflow.
* **Voice Interaction**: Natural, conversational, and responsive.
* **Text Interaction**: Clear, concise, and efficient.

### Requirement: Voice Input Validation

**Purpose**: Ensure reliable understanding of user voice commands by adding a validation and correction layer between speech-to-text and command execution.

**Requirements**:
1. **Error Detection**: System shall analyze speech-to-text output for:
   - Grammatical errors
   - Syntactical problems
   - Punctuation mistakes
   - Logical inconsistencies

2. **Correction Mechanism**: System shall apply corrections to recognized errors when confidence is high.

3. **Clarification Protocol**: When voice input is ambiguous or confidence in correction is low:
   - Agent shall prompt user with specific clarification questions
   - Agent shall present its understanding and ask for confirmation
   - User shall have ability to confirm, reject, or modify the interpreted command

4. **Input Processing Flow**:
   ```
   Voice Input → Speech-to-Text → Validation Layer → Correction/Clarification → Command Processing
   ```

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Background noise handling
   - Handling of specialized terminology
   - Adapting to user speech patterns over time

6. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Clarification frequency rate
   - Command rejection rate
   - Successful validation rate
   - Average processing time (target: <1 second)
