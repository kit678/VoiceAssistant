# Progress Log

## 2024-12-19 – ✅ Plan Mode Initialization Complete
- Created complete memory bank structure with all required files
- Drafted comprehensive PRD with 5W+H clarification framework  
- Established 15+ specific open questions across all requirement categories
- Set up task backlog with clear progression from clarification → setup → implementation
- Configured active context for systematic requirements gathering
- Ready to begin structured clarification phase per cursor rules methodology

## 2024-12-19 – ✅ Core Requirements Established
- Established Windows as primary target platform
- Prioritized voice interaction workflow as most critical initial feature
- Defined dedicated voice input validation layer with grammar/syntax checking
- Selected full cloud approach for all components (APIs, LLM, storage)
- Narrowed technology choices to accelerate MVP development
- Created new "Voice Input Validation" requirement section in PRD
- Reorganized task backlog with high-priority Voice Workflow MVP tasks
- Defined 9 core components for voice workflow implementation 

## 2024-12-19 – ⚠️ Electron Implementation Started with Issues
- Created Electron application structure with main process, preload script, and renderer
- Implemented configuration system using electron-store
- Added utility modules for hotkey management and logging
- Set up simulated voice processing flow for MVP demonstration
- Encountered issue with electron-store integration: "TypeError: Store is not a constructor"
- Attempted multiple fixes including correct import syntax, but issue persists
- Application currently unable to start due to configuration module error 

## 2024-05-24 – ✅ Application Startup and Hotkey Resolved
- Successfully diagnosed and resolved the `electron-store` compatibility issues by downgrading to v8.2.0 and ensuring correct CommonJS import syntax.
- Fixed the `TypeError: Store is not a constructor` error.
- Modified application startup behavior to show the main window immediately, instead of waiting for a hotkey.
- Changed the default activation hotkey to `Ctrl+Shift+X` to avoid conflicts with Windows system hotkeys.
- Implemented a temporary configuration reset on startup to clear stale settings and ensure new defaults are applied.
- Application now launches successfully, the main window is visible, and the `Ctrl+Shift+X` hotkey correctly toggles window visibility. Basic simulated interaction flow is observable.
