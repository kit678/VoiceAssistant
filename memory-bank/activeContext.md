# Active Context - 2024-12-19

## Today's Focus
**IMPLEMENTATION TROUBLESHOOTING**: Resolving electron-store integration issue in Electron MVP.

## Current Priority
1. **Error Resolution**: Fix "TypeError: Store is not a constructor" in the app-config.js module
2. **Configuration System**: Ensure electron-store is properly integrated for app settings
3. **Application Startup**: Achieve successful application launch

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Primary OS Target**: Windows-first approach confirmed
2. **Core Feature Priority**: Voice interaction workflow is the top priority
3. **Privacy/Cloud Preferences**: Full cloud approach using cloud APIs and storage
4. **Desktop Framework**: Electron selected for rapid MVP development
5. **Architecture**: Seven-node pattern with focus on voice workflow

## Key Decisions Pending
1. **Cloud Database**: Supabase (with MCP integration) vs Firebase (Google ecosystem alignment)
2. **LLM Provider**: OpenAI vs Google Gemini (with Google Cloud API integration) vs Anthropic Claude

## Current Implementation Status
1. ✅ Electron project structure setup following our defined architecture
2. ✅ UI shell with main process and renderer
3. ✅ Utility modules for hotkeys and logging
4. ✅ Simulated voice processing workflow
5. ⚠️ Configuration system with electron-store has integration issues
6. ❌ Application currently unable to start

## Known Issues
- **electron-store Error**: "TypeError: Store is not a constructor" in app-config.js
- Current import uses correct syntax `const Store = require('electron-store');` but application still fails
- Configuration module critical for application operation

## Success Criteria for Next Session
- [ ] Functional Electron application with working configuration
- [ ] Working hotkey activation
- [ ] Audio recording capability
- [ ] Initial Google Cloud Speech integration
- [ ] Simple text validation proof-of-concept

## Next Steps
1. Diagnose root cause of electron-store integration issue
2. Investigate potential CommonJS/ESM compatibility problems
3. Consider alternative configuration approaches if needed
4. Once configuration is working, proceed with remaining voice workflow components

## Planning Phase Completed
- [x] Critical platform and feature priorities established
- [x] Voice interaction validation requirements added to PRD
- [x] Desktop framework selected (Electron)
- [x] Architecture diagram created for voice workflow
- [x] Complete project structure defined
- [x] Implementation plan created

## Next Session Preview
Based on framework selection: Configure development environment, set up Google Cloud APIs, and create voice input capture MVP.
