# Voice Assistant Project - Planning Phase Results

## Clarification Phase Completed âœ…

Based on the user's responses, we've established the core requirements and technical direction for the Voice Assistant project.

### Critical Decisions Made

1. **Platform**: Windows-first approach
2. **Core Priority**: Voice interaction workflow with input validation
3. **Technology Stack**: 
   - **Desktop Framework**: Electron (for rapid MVP development)
   - **Speech Processing**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs (free tier)
   - **Architecture**: Cloud-based services with seven-node design pattern

### Key Requirements Added

- **Voice Input Validation**: Added detailed requirements for grammar/syntax validation and clarification protocols
- **Detailed Architecture**: Created comprehensive diagram of voice workflow components
- **Project Structure**: Defined modular Electron application organization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Voice Workflow MVP (Current Focus)

The prioritized implementation plan follows this sequence:

1. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Configure Electron project structure
   - Set up Google Cloud API access

2. **Core Voice Pipeline**
   - Implement hotkey activation
   - Develop audio capture module
   - Integrate Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
   - Create input validation layer
   - Build basic command interpreter

3. **Feedback Loop**
   - Implement response generation
   - Integrate Google Cloud Text-to-Speech
   - Create minimal UI for interaction feedback

This focused approach allows us to test the critical voice interaction flow as quickly as possible.

### Future Phases (Pending Completion of MVP)

1. **Goal Management Features**
   - Task breakdown logic
   - Prioritization algorithms

2. **Integration Layer**
   - Zapier connections to productivity tools
   - Cloud database for persistent storage

3. **Daily Briefing System**
   - Morning review capabilities
   - Daily planning features

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Initialize Electron project using the structure defined in `electron-setup.md`
2. Set up Google Cloud project and API credentials
3. Implement basic hotkey and audio recording functionality
4. Test initial Speech-to-Text integration
5. Develop input validation prototype
